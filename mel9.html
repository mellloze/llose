I started
playing it not just for fun,<br> but as a way to stay active and challenge myself. At first as a college student, I never imagined that a sport could have such a profound impact on my academic life and personal growth. My journey with badminton began in my first year at university, when I stumbled upon a flyer for the campus Badminton Club. At the time, I was looking for a way to stay active and meet new people, so I decided to give it a try — and that decision changed my college experience in ways I never expected.

I still remember my first practice. I had very little experience with badminton, and my movements were clumsy and unsure. But the atmosphere was welcoming. Senior members of the club were more than willing to guide beginners like me, and their passion for the game was contagious. With each session, I began to improve — learning how to grip the racket correctly, understanding footwork, and developing better reflexes.

As I grew more confident, I began participating in friendly matches and inter-college tournaments. Competing was both exciting and intimidating. I experienced both the thrill of victory and the sting of defeat, but through it all, I learned resilience, discipline, and the value of hard work. Waking up early for practice before classes, managing my time between training and studying, and balancing physical exhaustion with academic demands taught me time management and perseverance.</center><a href="mel8.html" style="margin-left: 1000px; text-decoration: none; color: white;">&nbsp; BACK</td>
