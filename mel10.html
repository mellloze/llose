Technology (BSIT) program, has been a mix of excitement, challenges, and growth. Stepping into college life felt
like entering a new journey filled with both challenges and opportunities. As a college student, I’ve experienced many ups and downs — from struggling with deadlines and exams to forming meaningful friendships and discovering my passions. Life as a student is far more than just attending classes; it’s about growing, adapting, and finding your place in the world.

In the beginning, adjusting to college life was difficult. I had to manage my own time, take responsibility for my learning, and balance multiple tasks at once. There were days when I felt overwhelmed, especially during exam weeks or when assignments piled up. I had to learn how to prioritize my tasks, manage my time wisely, and stay disciplined, even when I felt tired or unmotivated.

Despite the pressure, I also found joy in being a student. I enjoyed learning new things, participating in group discussions, and discovering subjects that sparked my interest. I also had the chance to join extracurricular activities, like sports and student organizations, which helped me build confidence and connect with others.

One thing I’ve come to appreciate is the importance of friendship and support. I met classmates who became my study partners, teammates, and trusted friends. We helped each other through difficult times — whether it was cramming for a test, working on a group project, or just venting after a long day. These connections made my student life more meaningful.</center><a href="mel8.html" style="margin-left: 1000px; text-decoration: none; color: white;">&nbsp; BACK</td>
