    <td style="font-size:23px; color: white;" width=1000px" height="380px"><center>My first year as a BSIT (Bachelor of Science in Information Technology) student was both exciting and <br>overwhelming. Coming from high school, I was surprised by how different college classes were—especially<br> subjects like computer programming, basic electronics, and information systems. I wasn’t just expected to listen; I had to think critically, solve problems, and apply what I learned through hands-on tasks. At first, it was hard to manage time, especially with <br>overlapping deadlines and technical tasks like debugging code or working on group projects. But as the semester went on, I slowly adapted. I started organizing my notes better, using apps and reminders to track assignments, and setting time each day just to review or practice coding. I also learned that asking questions—whether from classmates, instructors, or even online forums—was a smart move, not a weakness.</center></td>
