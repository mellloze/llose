<tr>
    <td style="font-size:20px; color: white;" width=1000px" height="380px"><center>Starting my first semester in BSIT was a big step into a new world. Everything felt different—new environment, new subjects, and a lot more responsibility. Adjusting wasn't easy, but a few things helped me get through it.

One of the most important things I learned was not to be afraid to ask questions. <br>Whether it was about confusing code, unclear topics, or assignment instructions, seeking help from classmates or instructors saved me from a lot of frustration.

Practicing coding regularly also made a huge difference. Programming is a core part of BSIT, and the more I practiced,<br> <br>the more comfortable I became with logic building and solving errors.
ime management was something I had to learn quickly. I started breaking large tasks into smaller parts and setting personal deadlines so I wouldn’t get overwhelmed right before submission dates.

Online resources were also a big help. Watching YouTube <br>tutorials, reading articles, or following coding examples gave me extra explanations when I needed them the most.

Lastly, building connections with my classmates helped me stay motivated. Study groups, class chats, and sharing notes created a sense of teamwork that made the experience less stressful.

Surviving my first semester wasn’t easy, but these habits helped me stay on track. It taught me that with the right mindset and support, I can handle the challenges that come with being a BSIT student.</center></td>
