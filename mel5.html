<tr>
    <td style="font-size:23px; color: white;" width=1200px" height="380px"><center>As a first-year BSIT student at EVSU – Carigara Campus, I walked into my first week of<br>
college with a mix of excitement and nerves. Like many others, I had my own ideas about<br>
what college would be like—but as the days went by, I quickly realized that expectations<br>
and reality don't always match up.<br>
Expectation: I’ll instantly make a lot of new friends.<br>
Reality: I did meet new people—but it took time.<br>
I thought I’d instantly click with everyone, but the truth is,<br> making friends in college is a,
gradual process. Everyone’s adjusting, just like you. It was a <br>little awkward at first, but as the
days went by, conversations started to flow naturally. Now, I’ve started to build real<br>
connections with my classmates.</center></td>
